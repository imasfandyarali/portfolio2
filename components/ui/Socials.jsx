/*
Hey there! Let me explain how this code works in a fun way! ðŸš€

1. First, we make a list (array) of our social media links, like a toy box with different toys:
   - We have GitHub (like a digital playground)
   - LinkedIn (like a place where grown-ups talk about work)
   - YouTube (where we watch videos)

2. Each social media link has two things:
   - An icon (like a small picture)
   - A path (like an address to get there)

3. The Socials component is like a magic box that:
   - Takes two special decorations (props):
     * containerStyles (how to style the whole box)
     * iconStyles (how to make each icon look pretty)

4. When the code runs:
   - It creates a div (like a container)
   - Then it looks at our list of social media links
   - For each social media link it:
     * Makes a clickable button (Link)
     * Puts the icon inside it
     * Makes it pretty with special effects when you hover over it
     * Adds the correct website address

5. The map function is like a helper that:
   - Takes each social media item from our list
   - Creates a beautiful button for it
   - Does this for every item in the list

6. When you click any icon:
   - It will take you to that social media website
   - The icon changes color when you move your mouse over it
   - It's like magic! âœ¨

This is why when you see the website, you'll see all three social media 
icons in a row, and they all work like magic buttons! ðŸŽ®
